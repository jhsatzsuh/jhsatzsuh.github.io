            <dd>NCT is a South Korean boy group formed by SM Entertainment. Their name stands for the Hallyu localization project Neo Culture Technology, a term coined by their producer and SM founder Lee Soo-man to describe the group's concept of having an unlimited number of members divided into multiple sub-units based in various cities worldwide. Since the group's initial introduction by their native label's founder in January 2016, the group consists of 23 members as of September 2020, aging from their late-teens to mid-twenties and participating in a total of four different sub-units.</dd>

Their name stands for 'Neo Culture Technology United'.This sub-unit is best described as a revolving door unit: any member(s) that fit(s) the concept of a song will perform it. An example, for their debut The 7th Sense, members Taeyong, Mark, Jaehyun, Ten, and Doyoung were in the line-up. And for Boss the line-up was Taeyong, Mark, Doyoung, Jaehyun, WinWin, Lucas, and Jungwoo. For more vocal heavy songs, NCT vocalist are used, such as Without You and Timeless.</dd>

The 127 represents the longitude coordinate of Seoul, South Korea, where the unit is localized in. 127 is NCT's 1st "fixed unit," this means that members can be added, but not removed. The sub-unit first debuted on 07/01/16, with members Taeyong, Taeil, Mark, Yuta, WinWin, Jaehyun, and Haechan. In Dec '16, members Doyoung and Johnny were added to the group. Sept '18, Jungwoo was announced as the latest addition. Days after their repack 'Regulate' was released, it was announced that member WinWin would no longer be participating in future 127 activities or comebacks as he was preparing to re-debut with NCT's China sub-unit WayV.</dd>
                
                <dt>NCT Dream</dt>
                <dd>The third sub-unit of NCT. Dream was made up of then mostly teenagers when they debuted in 2016. The narrative of their title tracks have conveyed thought following different stages of adolescent development, with transition from innocence to rebellion and growth. Initially, Dream followed an aged-based admission-graduation system in which members would move on from the unit after reaching the Korean age of 20 (19 internationally); however, in 2020, SM Ent announced the removal of the system, and former member Mark, who graduated at the end of 2019, would return to Dream, the group would then continue on with a flexible-style system. </dd>

                <dt>WayV</dt>
                <dd>The fourth sub-unit, and the only Chinese group, of NCT. It was theorized by journalist that the distancing of WayV from the NCT label was greatly due to the tense relations between China and South Korea. Regardless of this, SM Ent CEO has acknowledged WayV  as NCT's China-based unit. The group consists of  seven members: Kun, Ten, WinWin, Lucas, Xiaojun, Hendery, and YangYang.</dd>
